<h3> Where on earth is the animal found </h3>
	<p> Originally from Europe and Africa, Rabbits are now found all over the world </p>

 <h3> What natural surroundings does the animal need to thrive </h3>
 <p> Domestic rabbits need a regulated environment to protect against heat exhaustion or hypothermia. Wild rabbits don't have this problem and make their homes in various temperature extremes. Wild rabbits can be found in woods, forests, meadows, grasslands, deserts, tundra and wetlands </p>

 <h3> Where does the animal make its home </h3>
 <p> Wild rabbits create their own homes by tunneling into the ground. These tunnel systems are called warrens and include rooms for nesting and sleeping. They also have multiple entrances for quick escape. </p>
